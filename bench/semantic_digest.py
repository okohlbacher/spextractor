"""Semantic digest of an mzML: sha256 of the DATA (from <spectrumList onwards), ignoring the header.

Two runs of a perfectly deterministic tool can never be byte-identical, for two reasons that have
now each cost this project a false "determinism FAIL":
  1. OpenMS stamps MS:1000747 "completion time" from the wall clock;
  2. the header records the invocation's own parameters -- so a threads-8 run and a threads-100 run
     differ in the header by construction, which is precisely the comparison a thread-scaling
     determinism test wants to make.
Hashing from <spectrumList onwards compares what the science depends on: the spectra themselves.
(This also retroactively explains the July r1-vs-imw005 md5 mismatch recorded as unexplained.)
