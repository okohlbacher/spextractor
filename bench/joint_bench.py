"""Joint benchmark: pseudo-spectra x {Sage, MSFragger} -> FDR-corrected PSMs and peptides.

Metrics (the two the project is scored on):
    PSMs      at <=1% PSM-level FDR
    PEPTIDES  unique, at <=1% peptide-level FDR

Design decision that matters
----------------------------
Both engines are scored by ONE identical target-decoy procedure implemented here, NOT by each
engine's own FDR machinery (Sage's internal linear discriminant; MSFragger via
PeptideProphet/Philosopher or Percolator). Those pipelines differ in rescoring, in how they
aggregate PSM->peptide, and in their decoy handling, so comparing their outputs would confound
"which engine identifies more" with "whose FDR is more permissive".

For the same reason both engines search ONE pre-built decoy database with the same prefix
(Sage's `generate_decoys` is turned OFF), so the two see byte-identical search spaces.

What this deliberately does NOT do: rescoring. Sage's reported score is already
discriminant-rescored, MSFragger's hyperscore is not. That asymmetry is REPORTED, not silently
corrected -- adding Percolator to one side and not the other would reintroduce exactly the
confound this design removes. Read the engine comparison as "raw discriminating power under a
common FDR", and see LIMITATIONS at the bottom.

Peptide-level FDR
-----------------
Best-scoring PSM per distinct peptide sequence, then target-decoy over that reduced list --
the standard "picked" approach. This is the axis that matters here: we emit ~4.6 PSMs/peptide
against the reference implementation's 1.46, so PSM-level counts reward redundancy and peptide-level counts do not.
Both are reported precisely so the gap is visible rather than hidden.

# LIMITATIONS -- read before quoting any engine comparison
#
# * NO RESCORING. Sage's reported score is already discriminant-rescored; MSFragger's hyperscore
#   is not. Sage is therefore favoured on absolute counts. Adding Percolator to MSFragger alone
#   would reintroduce the confound this design removes; adding it to both is the correct fix and
#   is not done here. The TOOL comparison (the reference implementation vs DIAspeXtractor) is unaffected, because it is
#   made WITHIN an engine -- that is the comparison this harness exists for.
# * Peptide-level FDR is "picked" (best PSM per sequence). Modified forms of one sequence collapse
#   together; a peptidoform-level count would be larger for both.
# * PSM-level FDR is computed over (spectrum, peptide) pairs. Where an engine reports multiple
#   ranks per spectrum this is not the same as one-PSM-per-spectrum; report_psms is set to 1 for
#   both engines so the two agree.
# * No replicates. Measured run-to-run spread on this pipeline is 0.17%, so differences below
#   ~0.2% are noise.
