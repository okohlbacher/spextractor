"""Is the min_correlation gain REAL SIGNAL or an FDR RECALIBRATION artefact?

The top blocker found in review: peptides rise (+7.7%) while PSMs FALL (-6.6%) and
fdr_loss_pct shifts. Sage computes peptide_q from ITS OWN decoys per run, so q<=0.01 is a
DIFFERENT score cut in every arm -- the counts may not be comparable at all.

Decisive test, needing no new runs: apply ONE FIXED discriminant-score threshold to every arm.
  * gain persists at fixed score  -> REAL: the arm genuinely produces better-scoring spectra
  * gain vanishes at fixed score  -> ARTEFACT: same signal, looser effective cut

Also reports each arm's own 1%-FDR score threshold and its target/decoy counts, so a shift in the
decoy distribution is visible rather than inferred. A rising decoy count with a falling threshold
is the signature of recalibration.
