"""Where does the 9.51 PSMs/peptide come from -- within a cycle, or across cycles?

DIAspeXtractor emits 9.51 PSMs per peptide against the reference implementation's 1.69. That ratio alone cannot
distinguish two very different situations:

  WITHIN-CYCLE duplication   several pseudo-spectra generated from ONE diaPASEF cycle all match
                             the same peptide. That is a deconvolution/dedup failure: one cycle
                             physically contains one elution point for one precursor.

  ACROSS-CYCLE spread        the peptide elutes over many cycles and each cycle contributes one
                             spectrum. That is NORMAL and the reference implementation must show it too.

The total factorises exactly:

    PSMs/peptide  =  (PSMs per (peptide,cycle))  x  (cycles per peptide)
                     ^ within-cycle multiplicity    ^ elution spread

Only the first term is a defect. Running it on both tools separates them: if the reference implementation's
redundancy is nearly all elution spread and ours is not, the excess is ours to fix.

Cycle assignment: diaPASEF cycle period is 1.385 s for these runs (1,342 cycles over
0.02-31.00 min, 16,105 MS2 frames / 12 window groups), read from the raw analysis.tdf rather
than assumed.
