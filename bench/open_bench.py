"""Entrapment-controlled OPEN-search benchmark.

Why this exists
---------------
Every number in README.md comes from a CLOSED Sage search scored by peptide_q against a DIA-NN
reference whose space is tryptic / z2-4 / <=2 mods -- structurally incapable of containing the
class of thing this tool exists to find. We emit 4.6 PSMs/peptide against the reference implementation's 1.46, so
redundancy is free score under that metric. That single fact predicts, in advance, every result
observed: each redundancy-reducing lever losing, and ms1split winning while simultaneously
raising co-isolation 52% and dropping charge agreement below baseline.

Six falsifications sharing one biased instrument are one falsification.

Three measurements, in increasing order of how much they depend on assumptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DELTA-MASS GEOMETRY -- needs no ground truth, no decoy, no entrapment.
   A charge misassignment fabricates

       dM = (z' - z) * (m/z - PROTON)

   which is LINEAR IN m/z. In the 2-D (precursor m/z, dM) plane those PSMs fall on RAYS through
   (PROTON, 0) with integer slopes +-1, +-2, ... A real modification is a constant mass shift and
   forms a HORIZONTAL BAND. The two are geometrically separable by construction, so the sloped-ray
   mass fraction measures charge error IN THE ACTUAL USE CASE -- strictly better than the
   DIA-NN-anchored proxy, whose decoy floor reached 91.9%.

2. ENTRAPMENT FDR -- needs a foreign proteome but no target-decoy assumption.
   Open search grows the candidate space ~10^3x and decoy-based FDR degrades accordingly
   (Kong 2017; Chick 2015). Entrapment is the accepted validation when the search space changes
   (Wen, Freestone, Noble, Kall, Nesvizhskii, Nat Methods 2025).

3. MODIFIED-PEPTIDE COUNT at <=1% entrapment FDR -- the primary metric.

Pre-registered falsification (written before the first run)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Closed-search ratio split_count/base on dataset B = 8411/5817 = 1.446.

  * modified-peptide ratio >= 1.446  -> "the closed benchmark rewards shotgunning" is FALSIFIED.
                                        The defaults are vindicated for BOTH purposes, the six
                                        falsified levers stand, redundancy is load-bearing, and
                                        we stop trying to reduce it.
  * ratio materially < 1.0           -> the shipped defaults are ACTIVELY HARMFUL for the stated
                                        purpose and must be reconsidered.
  * 1.0 <= ratio < 1.446             -> real but overstated by the closed metric.

Replicate spread is 0.17% (4 runs of an identical effective config: 8411/8408/8406/8397), so a
ratio difference below ~0.2% is noise.

POSITIVE CONTROL, non-negotiable. The envelope arm has 10,199 known 4->2 confusions. They MUST
appear as slope -2 ray mass in sage_open_wide.json, and must be markedly weaker in the count arm.
If the control does not fire, the instrument is not measuring charge error and NO other number
from this script may be quoted -- that is the same mistake as reporting a confident result from an
assay whose control was never run.
