# Trace detection on integer arrays

**Why now.** After the scoring gate was fixed (parallel arrays, 2026-09-03) the window loop is
**90.9% trace detection** and 4.8% scoring. Everything else is rounding. Tracing is the tool.

**What it runs on today.** `materializeWindow()` rebuilds an OpenMS `PeakMap` from the compact store:
`Peak1D` (double m/z + float intensity) plus a parallel `FloatDataArray` of mobility, wrapped in an
`MSSpectrum` per frame -- ~20 B/peak against the store's 10 B, plus per-spectrum object overhead,
and every m/z is a double that was an integer twice over (a TOF bin, then a 1e-5 Da store index).
`MassTraceDetection` then matches by a ppm tolerance on those doubles.

**Goal.** Reimplement the SAME tracing semantics on integer arrays, with all three axes integer:

| axis | today | here |
|---|---|---|
| retention time | `double` per peak, per spectrum | `uint32` frame index on the global RT axis |
| m/z | `double`, twice-derived | `uint32` flight-time bin (`TofAxis`) |
| ion mobility | `double` 1/K0, from a `uint16` quantum | `uint16` TIMS scan index |

## 1. The mobility axis, derived without the vendor table

Within one frame the distinct 1/K0 values ARE the scans, so ranking them recovers the scan index
exactly: collect a frame's distinct mobility values (about a thousand), sort descending (1/K0 falls
as scan number rises), and a peak's rank is its scan. No TIMS calibration table is needed to say
that two peaks came from the same scan -- and comparing scans is what the gate actually wants,
because the calibrated value drifts frame to frame while the scan does not.

Tolerance conversion: `gate:delta_im` in 1/K0 becomes a scan count per frame, from that frame's own
ranked values. It is not a constant across frames, and pretending it is would be the same mistake as
a fixed ppm halo.

## 2. The data structure

```cpp
struct PeakSlab                    // one window, frame-major, 10 B/peak, no OpenMS objects
{
  vector<uint32_t> frame_off;      // F+1: frame f owns [frame_off[f], frame_off[f+1])
  vector<uint32_t> rt_index;       // F: frame -> global RT axis
  vector<double>   b;              // F: calibration factor, for export only
  vector<uint32_t> tof;            // ascending within a frame
  vector<float>    inten;
  vector<uint16_t> scan;           // TIMS scan index
};
```

Ascending `tof` within a frame is what makes extension a binary search over ~50k values rather than
a scan, and it comes free: the loader already sorts by m/z, which is monotone in TOF.

## 3. The algorithm, kept faithful to the current one

`MassTraceDetection` is: seed on the most intense unused peak; extend in both RT directions taking
the closest unused peak within the mass tolerance of a RUNNING centroid; stop a direction when the
hit rate over visited frames falls below `min_sample_rate`; emit if the length is in range. That is
what is reimplemented -- not a new algorithm -- so the comparison is about data structures, not
about science.

```
  order = peak indices sorted by intensity DESC          // seeding order, as today
  used  = bitset over peaks
  for seed in order:
      if used[seed] or inten[seed] < snr * noise: continue
      centroid = tof[seed]; sum = inten*tof; wsum = inten
      for dir in (+1, -1):
          misses = 0; visited = 0
          for f = frame(seed)+dir, stepping by dir:
              span = tofSpan(centroid, b[f], mass_ppm)        // integer, per frame
              k = closest unused peak in frame f with |tof-centroid| <= span
                                       and |scan - scan(seed)| <= scanTol(f)
              visited++
              if none: misses++; if hits/visited < min_sample_rate: break
              else: take it, update centroid, used[k] = true
      emit if length in [min_trace_length, max_trace_length]
```

Every inner step is: one binary search in a sorted `uint32` array, then a short linear walk over
candidates in the tolerance window. No doubles are compared, no objects are constructed, and the
peak arrays are touched at 10 B/peak instead of 20 B plus indirection.

**Valley splitting is NOT reimplemented.** `ElutionPeakDetection` runs afterwards on the traces this
produces, exactly as it does now, so that stage's behaviour is unchanged and out of scope.

## 4. What this is expected to buy, and what would falsify it

Trace detection is 3,869 s of 4,256 s of window-elapsed time on dataset D.

| source of gain | mechanism | estimate |
|---|---|---|
| no `PeakMap` materialisation | 20 B/peak + object overhead -> 10 B/peak, and the conversion loop disappears | memory: −1 to −2 GB per in-flight window |
| integer comparison | `uint32` difference instead of a ppm test on doubles | small; the loop is not ALU-bound |
| **cache** | a frame's peaks are three contiguous arrays instead of `Peak1D` + a parallel array behind an `MSSpectrum` | **the term that should dominate** |
| no double conversion | the store's integers are used as integers | one pass over 1.2e9 peaks removed |

**Estimate: 30-50% off trace detection, i.e. dataset D from 7:04 to roughly 5:00-6:00**, with peak memory
down by the materialisation. Stated as a range because the split between bandwidth and the
detector's own arithmetic has not been isolated -- the same uncertainty that made me underestimate
the scoring gate by a factor of five, in the conservative direction.

**Falsifier:** if trace detection does not fall by at least 15%, the cost was never the data
structure and is in the extension search itself -- in which case the lever is the search (bucketing
by tof, or capping candidates per frame), not the layout, and this refactor should be reverted
rather than kept for tidiness.

**Output.** Faithful, but not bit-identical: the seeding order among equal intensities and the
closest-peak tie-breaks will differ. Judged on identified peptides with both engines.

## 4b. What was measured (2026-09-03, after the fact)

The falsifier in section 4 fired. The first corrected detector reached parity on peptides (12,650
vs 12,642 on dataset D) and was SLOWER (9:28 vs 7:22), with lower occupancy (46.9x vs 78.9x) and MORE
peak memory (174 vs 166 GB). The estimate above was wrong about where the time was: not in the
layout of the peak arrays, but in bookkeeping the reimplementation added -- twelve per-band
full-window sorts and a calibration call per visited candidate. Those are removed in the version
after; its run decides whether anything of the 30-50% survives. The lesson is the same one the
scoring-gate result taught in the other direction: an estimate of where time goes is worth little
until a timer has been put on it.

**Outcome (22:32).** With valley splitting chunked and parallel: **6:53 wall against 7:17 for the
OpenMS path, 105 GB peak against 164 GB, window-loop CPU −24%.** So the design's claim survives in a
weakened form: the integer layout does pay, but only once the reimplementation stops adding serial
work the original did not have. The memory saving is the larger and the more certain of the two
gains, and it is what raises the number of windows the admission gate can keep in flight.

## 5. Risks, stated in advance

1. **`min_sample_rate` semantics.** OpenMS computes the hit rate over the frames it has visited in
   that direction. Reimplementing it subtly differently changes which traces survive, and it is the
   one MS2 trace-validity lever this project has found to matter.
2. **Seeding order.** OpenMS sorts by intensity; ties are broken by whatever the sort does. Ours
   must be deterministic, or runs will not reproduce.
3. **The `used` marking is the parallelism hazard.** It is what makes tracing sequential within a
   band; bands are independent, so the parallel structure is unchanged, but a shared `used` across
   bands would be a race.
4. **The mobility rank assumes a frame's distinct 1/K0 values are its scans.** If a converter has
   already merged or re-binned mobility, the rank is not the scan. This must be checked on real data
   before it is trusted, not assumed.
