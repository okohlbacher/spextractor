# Changelog

## v1.2.1 — 2026-09-11

Documentation and CI only: the extractor is byte-for-byte the 1.2.0 binary, and all four pinned digests
are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **A claim in 1.2.0 about the floating-point guard was wrong.** `src/DnoiseMs1.h` refuses a
  value-changing floating-point flag only when the compiler announces it through a predefined macro, and
  compilers differ more than the 1.2.0 entry said. Measured in CI: **GCC 11 announces none of
  `-freciprocal-math`, `-funsafe-math-optimizations`, `-fno-signed-zeros` or `-fassociative-math`**, so
  building with them there is not refused; GCC 16 announces all four; clang announces only
  `-funsafe-math-optimizations` and `-ffp-model=fast`, on x86-64. The flags still change the port's output
  and must not be used; `tests/test_dnoise_ms1.cpp` pins the window-gate boxes whatever the compiler says.
- **The CI step that asserts the guard now asserts what the compiler can actually see.** It probes each
  flag's predefined macros first, requires the `#error` for every announced flag, and reports the rest as
  unprotected instead of failing. On GCC 11 the old step failed the release commit.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-09-11

**Why 1.2.** This release succeeds the public v1.1.0 (2026-09-04). Two things in it are not backwards
compatible, and both are deliberate. **The tool is renamed DIAspeXtractor and the executable is
`diaspextractor`**, so every script that called `spextract` has to change and every ini file written by
1.x carries the old tool-name section and must be regenerated (`-write_ini`); the environment prefix,
the CMake option names and the repository URLs move with it, and there is no compatibility alias.
**The output is not digest-comparable with 1.1.0**: MS1 denoising is on by default, the integer
detector's band partition comes from the acquisition's metadata, detection runs in fixed
600-second retention-time cells, the valley splitter's smoothing window is run-wide, and the
streaming loader no longer drops the tail of every run; and three corrections carried over from the
unpublished v2.0.0 tree change spectra as well -- the MS1 arena-compaction fix (it overwrote ~1% of
precursor XICs), the `C4` calibration term (an additive mass offset on ModelType 1 acquisitions that
store a non-zero `C4`, so measured masses move for those files; bit-identical where `C4 == 0`) and
the window key now carrying the vendor `WindowGroup`. "Migrating from 1.1.0" below, together with
those three, is the complete list of what changed under you. Everything else in this release is memory, speed, less code and
corrections that leave the spectra alone -- and where an entry says *digest-identical*, that is a
measured property of the shipped digests, not a design intent.

**Where it stands.** At the shipped defaults, 100 threads, each pair back to back on one node: a
30-minute in-house acquisition (dataset D) runs in **3:47 at 21.99 GB peak RSS** and a 2-hour public
diaPASEF acquisition (PXD047793, run 009) in **9:57 at 21.07 GB** -- against 37.44 GB and 99.70 GB for
the identical output at one tile (`-tile:cells_per_tile 0`) on the same build, and against 57 GB / 2:54
and 187 GB / 11:18 before this cycle's memory work. The reference digests are `e43672a0` (dataset D) and
`3aafd0b5` (run 009) at the defaults, `8c1b047f` and `bff54a1f` with `-dnoise:ms1 false`. The record is
docs/BASELINE.md (sections dated 2026-09-08 to 2026-09-11).

### Migrating from 1.1.0

| what | 1.1.0 | 1.2.0 |
|---|---|---|
| executable and CMake target | `spextract` | `diaspextractor` |
| TOPP tool name: ini section, mzML software entry | `SpeXtract` | `DIAspeXtractor`; regenerate 1.x ini files with `-write_ini` |
| environment variables | `SPEXTRACT_*` | `DIASPEXTRACTOR_*`, including the three the patched libOpenMS reads (`DIASPEXTRACTOR_ALLOW_CHORD_FALLBACK`, `DIASPEXTRACTOR_SDK_PARALLEL`, `DIASPEXTRACTOR_LOAD_BATCH`) |
| CMake | `project(SpeXtract)`; mzPeak enabled with `-DMZPEAK_ROOT=<checkout>`, which defines `SPEXTRACT_WITH_MZPEAK` internally | `project(DIAspeXtractor)`; mzPeak still enabled with `-DMZPEAK_ROOT=<checkout>`, now defining `DIASPEXTRACTOR_WITH_MZPEAK`; plus the new option `DIASPEXTRACTOR_TESTS_ONLY` and the `DIASPEXTRACTOR_VERSION` compile definition |
| C++ namespace | anonymous | `diaspextractor::` (`spx::` unchanged) |
| sources | `src/spextract.cpp`, `test/test_spextract.py` | `src/diaspextractor.cpp`, `test/test_diaspextractor.py` |
| repository | `okohlbacher/speXtract` | `okohlbacher/diaspextractor` |
| OpenMS patches | two | four, all applied by `scripts/apply_openms_patches.sh`; the third and fourth are new since 1.1.0 and a tree without the third does not build the tool |
| reported version | OpenMS' | its own, with the OpenMS build alongside it (`--help` prints `Version: 1.2.0 (OpenMS ...)`), plus the ini `version` parameter and the output's software entry |
| the output file during a run | written straight to `-out` | written to `<out>.part` and renamed on completion; a failed run leaves no partial file |

- **`SPEXTRACTOR_*` variables are refused, not ignored.** An old name would now do nothing without a
  word, so the tool refuses to start while any `SPEXTRACTOR_*` variable is set, and names the variable
  and its `DIASPEXTRACTOR_` name (e2e check 22). `-DSPEXTRACTOR_TESTS_ONLY` likewise stops the CMake
  configure with an error; it used to be ignored, and the full build then failed far from the cause in
  `find_package(OpenMS)`. **The guard covers only `SPEXTRACTOR_*`, not 1.1.0's own `SPEXTRACT_*`
  prefix**, which is still silently ignored -- so if you carried a `SPEXTRACT_...` export over from
  1.1.0, rename it by hand: the tool will not tell you.
- **Only `SPEXTRACTOR_TESTS_ONLY` is refused at configure time.** Every other old `-D` name --
  `SPEXTRACT_TESTS_ONLY`, `SPEXTRACT_WITH_MZPEAK`, `SPEXTRACTOR_WITH_MZPEAK` -- is an unused cache entry
  that CMake accepts in silence, so a 1.1.0 build script that passed `-DSPEXTRACT_WITH_MZPEAK=ON`
  configures a build *without* mzPeak and says nothing. Use `-DMZPEAK_ROOT=<checkout>`.
- **No compatibility alias.** No `spextract` or `spextractor` executable is installed: both names are
  taken by other tools, which is why the tool was renamed in the first place. Anyone who needs the old
  command locally can link it (`ln -s diaspextractor spextract`).
- **The OpenMS patches carry the new names** -- namespace, the three variables, their messages and the
  patch comments -- and every hunk keeps its context, so they apply to the same pinned OpenMS commit.
  libOpenMS compiles the variable names in: a tree patched for an older release must be patched again
  from a pristine checkout of the pin (`scripts/apply_openms_patches.sh` also installs the renamed
  `TdfMzCalibration.h`) and rebuilt.
- **Unchanged by the rename:** the `spx:` run stamps and the `spx_guessed` / `spx_n_isotopes` precursor
  userParams. The bench tools and older outputs read them, and `spx_*` sits inside the spectrum digest.
- **Defaults that changed since 1.1.0.** With an entry of their own below: `dnoise:ms1` (new, on),
  `perf:ms1_prune` (new, on), `tile:cells_per_tile` (new, 1), `tile:rt_sec` (new, 600 s),
  `trace:band_edges` (new, `acquisition`) and `trace:split_scan_time` (new, `frame`). Recorded under
  v2.0.0 below, which was an internal tag but whose changes reach a 1.1.0 user here for the first time:
  `charge:min_charge` 2 -> 1 with the new `charge:im_charge_veto` (report FDR per charge -- the z=1
  stratum carries 3-9% entrapment FDR under one pooled 1% cut, depending on the file), `perf:ms1_trace_bands` 12 -> 48,
  `perf:malloc_trim` (new, on, and now trimming between tiles). Already in 1.1.0, so unchanged for you:
  `-threads` defaults to every core and the output format follows the `-out` extension.
- **Options and probe environment variables that no longer exist** are listed under "Removed". An ini
  file that sets one must be regenerated.

### Changed

- **MS1 denoising runs inside the tool, on the raw points before picking** (`dnoise:ms1`, default
  `true`). It is a bit-identical C++ port of dnoise v0.1.0's default MS1 path: Garrett, Diedrich &
  Yates III, bioRxiv 2026.08.27.747603; MIT, see NOTICE and LICENSES/dnoise-MIT.txt. Per MS1 frame it
  runs an ion-mobility streak filter (two passes), a halo filter, and the diaPASEF isolation-window
  gate.
  - It keeps 12.7% of dataset D's MS1 points and 20.5% of run 009's.
  - The output is digest-identical to running the tool on dnoise's own filtered `.d`, so the searches
    recorded for that route apply: **dataset D Sage -4.3%, MSFragger -4.0% peptides; run 009 +1.5% and
    -0.5%**; entrapment FDR inside the control's interval on D, just below it on run 009.
  - New reference digests: **D `e43672a0`, run 009 `3aafd0b5`** (with `-dnoise:ms1 false`, `8c1b047f`
    and `bff54a1f`).
  - Memory at one cell per tile, against the prune-on default: D peak 25.90 -> 22.48 GB (-13%),
    run 009 31.97 -> 25.17 GB (-21%); wall D 4:13 -> 3:41 (-13%); on run 009 the wall change depended
    on the node and the run (-15% to +3% across three shared-node pairs).
  - Bruker `.d` input only. Other inputs are not filtered, and the header records it (`spx:dnoise_ms1`).
  - It refuses in milliseconds, naming the escape, when `trace:native_ms1_neighbors` > 0, or when a
    point's flight-time index, scan index or raw intensity cannot be recovered exactly from the
    loader's values.
  - **`-dnoise:ms1 false` restores the previous output.** Defaulting it on was the user's decision,
    taken with the dataset D result in hand: it costs peptides on D and gains a little on run 009, and
    it is what makes the memory figures above reachable.
- **`tile:cells_per_tile` defaults to 1: one 600-s retention-time cell per tile** (it arrived in this
  cycle at 0, one tile). The spectra are digest-identical for any tile count, so only memory and wall
  move. Final build, 100 threads, dnoise and the prune on, each pair back to back on one node:
  - run 009: **99.70 GB at one tile, 21.07 GB at 13 tiles** with the trim between tiles; wall
    9:42 -> 9:57.
  - dataset D: **37.44 GB at one tile, 21.99 GB at 3 tiles** with the trim between tiles; wall
    3:15 -> 3:47.
  - `-tile:cells_per_tile 0` restores one tile. mzPeak output is written in one piece, so a run that
    writes mzPeak runs all its cells as one tile (the whole run's memory) and logs a warning. The
    output format is resolved before the load; an mzPeak run with more than one tile used to be refused
    only after the load and the MS1 tracing.
- **`perf:malloc_trim` (on) also trims between tiles**, after tile k is written and before tile k+1 is
  read. It takes about 4 GB off run 009 and 0.5 GB off D at the defaults. The `[trim] tile k/n` log
  line is unchanged.
- **Not adopted: an eager glibc trim threshold** (`M_TRIM_THRESHOLD` 64 MiB with `M_TOP_PAD` 0). On
  run 009 it went only 0.3 GB below the between-tile trim (20.73 against 21.07 GB) and nearly tripled
  the MS1 load (34.3 -> 96.3 s); on D it cost 11% wall (3:41 -> 4:06).
- **The integer detector's band partition comes from the acquisition's metadata**
  (`trace:band_edges=acquisition`, the default). Each isolation window is traced in flight-time bands;
  their edges used to be the window's resident peaks' extremes -- data a reader holding only a tile's
  frames cannot see. They are now `[0, DigitizerNumSamples - 1]` (the digitizer's last bin through the
  store's quantum, or the acquisition's upper m/z through the calibration, whichever is larger):
  run-level constants from `analysis.tdf`'s GlobalMetadata. The interior edges move by a bin or two,
  which re-assigns the seeds nearest each edge; measured against `slab` on the same build: dataset D
  Sage 13,491 vs 13,490 (13,488 common), MSFragger 12,918 both, entrapment FDR 1.30% both; run 009 Sage
  29,067 vs 29,066, MSFragger 27,949 vs 27,952, entrapment 1.09% vs 1.08%. `-trace:band_edges slab`
  reproduces the earlier output. With the integer detector, `acquisition` refuses an input without a
  tdf before loading (`-trace:detector openms` is the escape); the header records `spx:band_edges`.
- **The valley splitter's smoothing window comes from the acquisition's cycle time**
  (`trace:split_scan_time=frame`, the default; `trace` restores the old behaviour). OpenMS
  ElutionPeakDetection derives its Savitzky-Golay window from each mass trace's own average cycle time,
  and the tool hands it a trace's real points only, so a trace with gaps was smoothed with a narrower
  window than its neighbours and split more. With one run-wide window the traces are fewer and longer
  -- 37% fewer MS1 traces and 28% fewer spectra on D, 16% fewer spectra on run 009 -- and identify MORE
  peptides: Sage 12,625 -> 13,388 (+6.0%) and 27,859 -> 28,845 (+3.5%), MSFragger 12,236 -> 12,732
  (+4.1%) on D, with the entrapment FDR at nominal 1% moving from 1.35% to 1.16% there (12,496 vs
  11,722 target peptides against the entrapment database). Found while measuring RT tiling: the
  per-trace window made a trace's split depend on where the run was cut. The EPD patch gains an
  advanced `scan_time` parameter (0 = the OpenMS default).
- **mzPeak input runs the integer detector.** mzPeak native IDs now carry `frame=<Id>` and the
  flight-time axis is built from the archive's embedded (or sidecar) `analysis.tdf`; before, every
  mzPeak spectrum was unmappable and the tool fell back to the OpenMS detector with a warning. On the
  30-minute archive: 855,561 spectra, Sage 12,537 (the `.d` gives 12,625; the OpenMS detector on the
  same archive 12,756). Archives converted without the vendor tdf need
  `DIASPEXTRACTOR_MZPEAK_TDF=<analysis.tdf.gz>`.
- **Every isolation window's frame table is frozen from the reader's metadata** (digest-identical on
  both pinned acquisitions and on the mzPeak archive). The window store's frame sequence, the Pearson
  support (`G` = the window's frame count) and the MS1-frame to window-frame map are now run-level
  constants read from the loader (the calibration patch exports the `.d` frame table and windows; the
  mzPeak reader's metadata sweep is cached), not from whatever frames happen to be resident. The
  consumer walks each window's delivered frames in lockstep with its table and appends every frame the
  reader skipped as an empty frame, counted per window (`[frames] window W: delivered N, padded P`; 0
  on both benchmark files). What changed is that a window traced and scored with only some of its
  frames resident now reproduces the whole run exactly (the cell-exactness probe: 100% of spectra
  identical with 16,586 of 32,210 frames padded), which is the property the tiled reader rests on. The
  header stamps `spx:frame_table` (`loader` | `mzpeak` | `slab`) and `spx:pearson_G=frames`; a
  frame-table mismatch is a fatal structural error, never a fallback.
- **The point recovery moved into `DnoiseMs1.h`** (`spx::dnoise::recover`), inside its
  contraction-off region, where the unit test reaches it; `DnoiseRun` maps its refusals to the same
  messages. Digest-identical.
- **`DnoiseMs1.h` refuses more floating-point flags at compile time**: a compiler that announces
  reciprocal or associative math, no signed zeros or ARM fast FP (`__RECIPROCAL_MATH__`,
  `__ASSOCIATIVE_MATH__`, `__NO_SIGNED_ZEROS__`, `__ARM_FP_FAST`). Only clang still slips past:
  `-freciprocal-math`, `-fassociative-math` and `-fno-signed-zeros` on every target, and
  `-funsafe-math-optimizations` and `-ffp-model=fast` on x86-64.
- **`-ffp-contract=off` stays on for the whole tool.** Builds for FMA-capable targets such as arm64 or
  `-march=haswell` are now contraction-free like the cluster reference; default x86-64 builds and all
  pins are unchanged.
- **The tool no longer phones home.** OpenMS builds with `ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=ON` by default, and
  TOPPBase then made a REST request on *every* invocation, carrying this tool's name and version; on an
  offline node or behind a proxy it printed `QIODevice::read (QNetworkReplyHttpImpl): device not open`
  to stderr -- the stream this project's own harness parses -- and users reported it as ours. `main()`
  now sets `OPENMS_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK` before TOPPBase runs, with `setenv(..., 0)` so an explicit
  setting of your own still wins, and `.github/workflows/build.yml` asserts on every full build that
  `--help` from a clean environment carries no `QIODevice`/`QNetwork` line. This is what SECURITY.md's
  "does not phone home, collect telemetry, or transmit anything" now rests on. The same change gives
  `--help` a `Version:` line carrying both numbers -- the tool's own and the OpenMS build it was
  compiled against -- because a bug report needs both.
- **The cluster deploy script (development repository) deploys as one transaction on the node.** It
  uploaded sources and headers before taking the lock, and a failed unit test or build restored only
  the `.cpp`. It now stages every file with checksums, takes the lock, runs both unit tests
  (`test_dnoise_ms1`, `test_tdf_load`) from the stage, promotes by rename, re-checks the hashes after
  the build, writes the provenance only on commit, and restores every promoted input on any failure.
  The provenance field `tool_headers_sha256` now also hashes `DnoiseMs1.h`, and a new field
  `tdf_load_unit_test` reads `passed`, or `skipped(<why>)` on a node without SQLite.

### Added

- **`tile:cells_per_tile` -- the window loop runs tile by tile.** The retention-time cells are grouped
  into tiles of n cells; each tile traces its isolation windows on the tile's frames only, owns the
  precursors whose MS1 frame time lies in [T_k - delta_rt, T_{k+1} - delta_rt) (decided with the
  scorer's own arithmetic, so a precursor never has a candidate at or beyond its tile's upper edge),
  scores them with the previous tile's boundary fragments carried over (every fragment within
  2 delta_rt of the edge, re-carried transitively), and its spectra are sorted and written as one block
  through the streaming writer before the next tile starts. **Output is the same for every n by
  construction of the cell grid** -- measured: dataset D at pitch 300 as 1, 2, 3 and 6 tiles at 8 and
  100 threads, and run 009 at 600 as 13 tiles, spectrum for spectrum identical to the one-tile runs;
  Sage reads the tiled file as the same file (13,836 peptides on D at 300 either way). A tiled file
  declares its count through a same-width placeholder patched at the end (`count="0000611034"`), which
  the digest tools normalise. The mzML is written as `<out>.part` and renamed on completion, so a
  failed run never leaves a plausible partial file behind.
- **`tile:rt_sec` -- detection in fixed retention-time cells (default 600 s).** The integer detector
  traces each window per RT cell cut at the run's MS1 frame times, so the output is digest-identical
  however the cells are grouped into tiles and however many threads run (at a fixed
  `perf:trace_bands`); the cut lines are stamped into the header (`spx:tile_rt_sec`,
  `spx:tile_boundaries`). This is what makes a tiled run reproduce the whole run exactly -- the halo
  designs could not (docs/BASELINE.md, "cause 2 vs cause 3"). Mass traces that elute across a cut line
  are cut there: on run 009 at 600 s, Sage 28,845 -> 29,066 (+0.8%) with 9.4% of the peptides within
  15 s of a line lost against 6.0% elsewhere (the usual set churn); on dataset D Sage +0.8%,
  MSFragger +1.5%, entrapment FDR 1.16 -> 1.30% (inside its interval); 300 s gives Sage +3.4% at 1.38%
  entrapment and is not the default. `-1` is one cell = the previous output, byte-identical.
- **`perf:ms1_prune` (default `true`) -- picked MS1 centroids the tracer can never use are dropped at
  load.** The prune keeps every peak above `trace:noise_threshold_int`, plus each spectrum's first and
  last peak and a minimal chain of sub-threshold witnesses. The band edges are sampled before pruning.
  Together these keep every MS1 band spectrum and the tracer's input exact, so **the digests are
  identical with the prune off and on** on both benchmark files and on dnoise-filtered input. Peak at
  one cell per tile, with dnoise off: D 31.99 -> 25.90 GB, run 009 69.11 -> 31.97 GB.
- **`DIASPEXTRACTOR_LOAD_TRIM=<n>`, a probe, off by default.** Calls `malloc_trim(0)` every nth picker
  flush. The repaired ledger shows the resident arm's process peak on D is not live data: RSS falls
  45,279 -> 28,052 MiB at the end of the load while the charged total does not move, so ~17 GiB of the
  peak is one load's worth of allocator free list. `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_` cannot reach it, because
  `free()` trims only the top of the main arena and with ~100 threads the retention sits in per-thread
  arenas.
- **The end-to-end suite is 25 checks, 26 in a build that writes mzPeak** (13 before this cycle). New, among them:
  **14** the declared spectrum count, `id="spectrum=K"`, `index="K"` and every `<indexList>` offset
  agree; **15** thread invariance at a pitch that cuts the fixture in two, and that a one-tile run
  traces two or more cells; **19d** a NaN or infinite MS1 m/z is refused before the prune, at 1 and 48
  bands, prune off and on; **21** a `.d`
  holding only an `analysis.tdf` is refused before any loader output when `OPENMS_BRUKER_SDK_PATH` is
  set, and without it gets past the dnoise setup and fails in the loader; **22** a leftover
  `SPEXTRACTOR_*` variable refuses the run before it starts; **18b**, in a build that writes mzPeak (a
  plain build skips it), that mzPeak output at the default runs its cells as one tile. Checks 15-18
  name `-tile:cells_per_tile 0` for their one-tile runs. The suite counts the checks it ran instead of
  keeping a hand-written sum.
- **Unit tests.** `tests/test_dnoise_ms1.cpp`: the point recovery on both benchmark files' metadata
  (every TOF bin, every scan also at +/-1 ulp, every raw count below 2^20 and every 7th up to 2^24,
  each refusal), the delivery bitmap, and `iterations 0` still running the halo and the gate.
  `tests/test_tdf_load.cpp`, new, built wherever SQLite3 is found: temporary tdfs with absent,
  column-less and corrupt window tables, a corrupt Frames page and out-of-range Frames values.
- **CI**: negative compile steps for the refused floating-point flags; `build.yml` runs the
  `dnoise_ms1` and `tdf_load` ctests in the full tool build; in the development repository the Linux
  leg also runs the cluster deploy script against a fake node behind ssh/scp shims (the public
  repository skips that step). CI syntax-checks every tracked Python file rather than an arbitrary
  fifth of them, and `apply_openms_patches.sh` checks the OpenMS pin it documents.
  `scripts/check_option_tokens.py`, new, asserts that every `-<group>:<option>` token in the shipped
  examples and README is an option the tool registers -- from the source on every push, and from the
  built binary's own `-write_ini` inventory in the full build. A removed option left inside an example
  makes the tool abort before it does any work, and this release shipped one that far.

### Fixed

- **The streaming loader dropped the last `n mod 256` MS2 window spectra of every run.** The pick
  consumer's tail flush was overridden but never invoked (OpenMS reaches it only through
  `retrieveSwathMaps`, which the streaming path does not use). The `.d` reader hands frames over window
  group by window group, so the loss fell on the last group: on a 31-minute file the last 105 cycles of
  two windows (210 of 32,210 spectra); on mzPeak input the last ~9 cycles of every window. The earlier
  note "`PICK_BATCH` is fast and rejected -- the picker carries per-thread state" was this bug: at 4096
  the dropped tail was two whole windows plus 427 frames of two more, 11% of the MS2 spectra. With the
  tail kept, batch 256 and 4096 produce the identical digest: the picker is per-frame pure and the
  batch size is a resource knob. Dataset D: +758 spectra, Sage 12,609 -> 12,625 peptides. **Output
  changes; digests re-pinned.**
- **The parallel mzML writer emitted an empty `<indexList>`** (`count="0"`, one dummy entry): the
  per-thread handlers' spectrum offsets were discarded on concatenation. Search engines do not read the
  index, so no result was affected; the file was not a valid indexedmzML. Offsets are now rebased as
  each chunk is appended, and an independent validator checks every offset on the benchmark output
  (854,817 spectra).
- **The GlobalMetadata axis bounds** (the `trace:band_edges=acquisition` preflight) are parsed with the
  dnoise grammar in the C locale, so a decimal-comma `LC_NUMERIC` no longer refuses `99.990834`.
  Leading whitespace, hex-float, subnormal and underflowing values are now refused. New unit-test case.
- **An mzPeak frame with peaks but an empty ion-mobility array** is refused as a short array; it used to
  be read out of bounds.
- **`DIASPEXTRACTOR_TILE_RESIDENT` is parsed once.** With it set to `0` or empty, `trace:band_edges=slab`
  on a `.d` is refused before the load, as with the variable unset, instead of after it.
- **AccumulationTime is read as opentims reads it**: the tdf's text is parsed in the classic locale,
  whole, finite and above 0. A decimal-comma locale used to turn "99.953" into 99. A frame above 100 ms
  (a correction below 1, several raw counts per intensity) is refused at setup, and a corrected
  intensity at or above 2^24 has its own refusal.
- **Every sqlite call of the tdf reader is checked**: each prepare, `SQLITE_DONE` after every row loop,
  the optional `DiaFrameMsMsWindows` table decided from `sqlite_master` instead of from a failed query,
  and sqlite's own error text in the refusal; the calibration and axis-bound readers likewise. A corrupt
  page used to end the windows loop as if complete (1,554 of 3,000 windows on a probe; no gate at all on
  a one-page table). NULL `ScanNumBegin`/`ScanNumEnd` are refused.
- **Frames values are type- and range-checked before narrowing**: `NumScans`, `NumPeaks`, `MsMsType`,
  `TimsCalibration` and `MAX(NumScans)` must be stored integers in range, and an MS1 frame with points
  needs a scan. The refusal names the frame and the column; `NumScans` -1 used to become 4,294,967,295.
- **The 1/K0 scan tables are built per TimsCalibration row** over the scans of the MS1 frames that use
  it, not over the run's `MAX(NumScans)`, so an unused row or scans no MS1 frame has no longer refuse a
  run. The window gate keeps the run's maximum, as dnoise does.
- **The loader's m/z model is checked on the first MS1 frame**, not after a batch of 256, and before the
  load when a Bruker SDK path is set (`OPENMS_BRUKER_SDK_PATH`): the loader then calibrates m/z through
  the SDK, which the TOF recovery cannot invert.
- **Every MS1 frame is denoised exactly once.** The resident pick filters an MS1 frame before its
  ion-mobility skip, as the streaming consumer does, and a per-frame bitmap refuses a frame delivered
  twice or a non-empty MS1 frame never delivered.
- **A non-finite MS1 m/z is refused right after the pick**, on both load paths, prune on or off, and
  past the stream fallback. It used to pass silently; sorted out of order around it, the band builder
  could drop every trace between two band edges. The `[ms1-prune]` line keeps its `bad_mz` field, now
  always 0.
- The resident load frees the filter's per-thread scratch right after the pick (up to ~4 GiB at 100
  threads), and a stream fallback zeroes the `[ms1-hist]` counters.
- `dnoise:iterations 0` skips the streak filter only; the halo filter and the window gate still run (the
  help said it kept every point).
- `--helphelp` no longer aborts. The `tile:` option group had no registered subsection.
- The one-shot-load peak picker no longer runs, and no longer logs "Loaded 0 frames.", on the streaming
  default; the compact-store digest no longer hashes an empty map on the integer path.

### Removed

The spectrum digests are unchanged on every accepted input by all of the following: each removed option
defaulted to its no-op value and each removed variable was a probe.

- **Twenty-four falsified options**, the count at the simplification pass (commit `9a6c2d4`: 71 registered
  options to 47, 21 fewer in the plain `--help`). Across the whole release 27 options go and 19 arrive
  (`trace:split_scan_time`, `tile:rt_sec`, `tile:cells_per_tile`, `trace:band_edges`, `perf:ms1_prune`
  and the 14 `dnoise:` options), so **the shipped tool registers 63 options** -- 70 items in `-write_ini`
  with TOPPBase's seven common parameters. Each removed option either carried
  a falsification verdict in its own help text or had no measurement on record: the `merge:` and
  `consolidate:` groups, the cross-precursor redistribution family (`rp_max`, `competitive`,
  `apportion`), the wavelet smoother and its selftest, post-centroiding frame aggregation,
  `open_search_safe` (a documented no-op), `rank_by`, `ambiguity_margin`, `max_trace_length_sec`,
  `dedup_precursors` and `split_valleys_fwhm`. `gate:variance_support`, `gate:coelution`, the two
  averagine-monoisotope flags and `charge:scoring=envelope` are deliberately kept: the record says to
  keep them. Four finished experiment knobs, a never-called accessor, an orphaned doc comment, a
  duplicate option read and a struct member with no reader go with them.
- **Three more options with no measured non-default value.** An ini file that sets one must be
  regenerated (`-write_ini`), and the mzML header no longer lists them:
  - `trace:ms1_min_sample_rate` and `trace:ms2_min_sample_rate`: the default -1 selected
    MassTraceDetection's own 0.5, and the MS2 option's help recorded that 0.3 and 0.1 lose peptides.
  - `trace:native_ms2_neighbors`: never benchmarked, and the `.d` streaming reader the tool calls never
    read it. The `[stream]` load line no longer prints it. `trace:native_ms1_neighbors` stays; its help
    now stands on its own.
- **Finished probe environment variables** (`SPEXTRACT_`-prefixed in 1.1.0, `SPEXTRACTOR_` in the
  development tree): `MS2_RT_RANGE`, `WINDOW_FILE` and `WINDOW_FILE_OUT` (the
  tiling plan's step-1 probe, superseded by the cell grid), `FRAG_DUMP` and `FRAG_DUMP_RT`,
  `PICK_SERIAL`, `PICK_STATIC`, `PICK_MZ_MODE` ("under test" in v0.3.0; `weighted` stayed),
  `Z1_CHARGE_UNSET`, `PRECURSOR_LIST`, and `TILE_TRIM`, which is now folded into `perf:malloc_trim`.
- **Log lines no tool reads**: the window-loop stage breakdown and its `score gate` line, the `MS1` and
  `MS2` RT-span lines, `Measured MS1 FWHM`, `[ms2ext]`, `[gstat]`, the per-tile `[tof] window` line,
  `[probe]`, and the `not-a-frame` and `trimmed-out` fields of `[soa-rt]` (always equal to `off-grid`,
  and always 0). `[perf]`, `[det]`, `[trim]`, `[tile]`, `[infer]`, `[tstage]`, `[dnoise]`,
  `[ms1-prune]` and `[ms1-hist]` are unchanged.
- **Dead code**, digest-identical: the unreachable envelope-off sort in the envelope scorer, the
  always-zero monoisotope bin fields of a precursor (MS1 traces carry no flight-time bin),
  `TofAxis::span`, the `compactify()` copy of `compactifyInto()`, the `_OPENMP` and `_WIN32` branches of
  a build that requires OpenMP and POSIX, and one-caller layers (`scoreCandidates_`, `weighted_` and
  `assembleFromList_` are now `assembleOne_`). Boilerplate goes too, from `CMakeLists.txt` (one
  `-ffp-contract=off` declaration), the unit tests and the e2e suite.
  **The simplification pass alone took 1,357 lines out of `src/`** (2,050 removed, 693 added, commit
  `d200db4`). Across the release `src/` is 994 lines *longer* than at v2.0.0 (5,335 -> 6,329), because
  the new `src/DnoiseMs1.h` is 723 of them and the cell grid, the tiled writer and the MS1 prune are
  the rest: the simplification paid for the features, it did not shrink the tool.
- Option help is cut to the fact, the escape and a pointer to the measurement, and several help texts
  are corrected: `assembly:im_weight_sigma` changes which fragments survive the cap;
  `assembly:default_charge` does nothing while `require_isotope_support` is on; `trace:band_edges` falls
  back to the OpenMS detector, rather than refusing, when there is no tdf; `perf:ms1_trace_bands` and
  `perf:trace_bands` are not exact partitions; a single `%` replaces `%%`, which printed literally; and
  the three options whose output does not depend on their value say *digest-identical* in so many words.
  Comments are trimmed to their invariants; the measurement history stays in docs/BASELINE.md and git.

### Measured

Everything in this section is digest-identical on both pinned acquisitions unless the entry says
otherwise, so the peptide sets are unchanged by construction and no search was needed.

- **Four changes, interleaved A/B on a 2-hour acquisition, arms alternating on one node:
  13:42.9 -> 11:17.6 mean wall, -17.7%, peak memory unchanged.**
  - **The Savitzky-Golay coefficients are cached (OpenMS patch).**
    `ElutionPeakDetection::smoothData()` constructed a filter and called `setParameters()` on every mass
    trace, and `updateMembers_()` recomputes the coefficients with one Eigen SVD per half-window each
    time. They depend only on (frame_length, polynomial_order) -- a handful of values in a run -- while
    `smoothData()` runs once per trace, hundreds of millions of times. A thread_local cache leaves the
    coefficients, the filtering loop and every float conversion untouched. **MS1 tracing CPU -40%,
    window loop -22.5%.**
  - **mzML spectra are encoded in parallel and written in order (fourth OpenMS patch).** Writing was the
    largest serial block left, 10.7% of the run at 1.0x, and it is CPU-bound rather than I/O-bound: it
    sustained ~400 MB/s against a filesystem measured at 4.0 GB/s. Serialising one spectrum is
    independent of every other; only the concatenation is ordered. **WRITE 90.0 s -> 21.1 s; the phase's parallel scaling goes
    1.0x -> 49x.** Each thread needs its own handler and validator -- OpenMS' writer memoises CV-term
    validation in mutable state, and sharing one handler corrupts the heap.
  - **The canonical sort sorts keys, not spectra**, and the assembled PeakMap takes the vector whole.
    `std::sort` moves what it is handed, and an `MSSpectrum` is ~750 bytes against 32 for a key.
    **SORT -61%; the ASSEMBLE phase is gone.**
- **The `Trace` record is 40 bytes, down from 48, at byte-identical output.** The retention time is an
  index into the run's frozen frame table rather than a cached `double` (a child trace's RT really is a
  frame time: the `off-grid` counter is 0 once the frame offset is signed, so `frame0 + rt_at` is
  invariant under trimming), and `TraceStore::bins` stores the flight-time bin as an `int16` offset from
  the trace's own bin instead of a `uint32`. Interleaved A/B, arms alternating on one node: **peak RSS
  -5.50 GB (-2.96%) on the 2-hour acquisition and -1.90 GB (-3.29%) on dataset D**, total CPU flat at
  -0.06% and the window loop -- where all 2.14e9 records live -- within 0.14%; every arm
  `SPECTRUM DATA IDENTICAL`. Adopted on memory at CPU parity, not on wall. It also prices what is left:
  parents are freed at the split, so ~49 GiB of records are resident at the peak rather than the naive
  95.8, and **every further per-record byte is worth ~0.7 GB at the peak, not ~2 GB** -- the coefficient
  to price the remaining field removals with.
- **The drained compact store is returned when the last window has materialised.** The window loop's
  peak held ~40 GB of dead per-frame vectors in the allocator's free list for its whole life; one
  `malloc_trim` at the moment the last window's slab exists returns it. Interleaved A/B on a 2-hour
  acquisition, two reps each: **peak RSS 169.1 -> 138.1 GB (-18%)**, wall within the pair spread.
- **The mzML is written by a streaming writer (`TileWriter`)**: header once, spectra appended in the
  canonical order in parallel-encoded chunks with the index offsets rebased as they land, the declared
  count exact when the total is known and a same-width placeholder otherwise. Bytes from
  `<spectrumList>` on are the bulk writer's; **WRITE 19.6 -> 13.2 s on dataset D** (the per-thread
  encoders no longer share a handler). Emitted spectra now carry `id="spectrum=<rank>"`.
- **The loader builds each window's peak slab directly.** The per-window `CompactFrame` store and its
  copy at window start are gone; frames are appended as they are picked, m/z quanta become flight-time
  bins in place when the window starts, and the batch's windows are appended in parallel from one
  reusable scratch. Output and every per-window slab digest identical. It costs +12 s of LOAD on
  dataset D today (first-touch page faults on fewer threads; on the backlog) and lifts the load-phase
  peak by ~3 GB there, below the window loop's peak on a 2-hour file.
- **MS1 traces are ordered by content only** (m/z, RT, mobility, intensity, point count, span, first
  frame time); the number of equal-key neighbours is logged (0 on the benchmark file).
- **The per-structure memory ledger and the phase table were repaired** (instrumentation only; no
  shipped behaviour changes). Three independent reviewers refused to price allocator reclamation off the
  previous version, and each of their four objections was correct. The tile loop's read, sort and write
  all run INSIDE the window loop, and the table summed every row, so `TOTAL(measured)` reached 105-109%
  of the run and the unattributed column went negative; phases now carry a nesting depth and an enclosed
  row is marked and left out of the sum. The MS1 band partition -- a full copy of the MS1 map plus a
  1-5% halo, and the largest allocation of the MS1 phase -- was carried under `ms1_map` until detection
  returned; it is handed to `band_arena` at the swap and released band by band, and it measures
  **13.6 GiB on dataset D where the old ledger reported 0.6**. A window's emitted spectra were charged
  only after the stage that produces them, and are now charged as they are emitted, together with the
  ~700 bytes of empty slot header per owned precursor. The columns were `>>20` of a byte count and were
  labelled `_mb`; they are `_mib`, and `bench/ledger_report.py` reads either. MassTraceDetection's own
  internal copy of each band remains unattributed: charging it needs an OpenMS patch, and the source now
  says so where the gap is.
- **Review and fix passes.** The dnoise port was reviewed twice before it was defaulted on, and the
  release candidate was reviewed twice more: a code round that produced the memory default, the
  simplification pass and the export scrubs, and a re-review of the renamed tree that produced seven
  further fixes (three of them holes in the deploy transaction, the rest help text and comments that
  described the code as it used to be). Each pass is recorded with its verdicts. **The last round ran
  two external reviewers and an internal pass instead of the usual three external reviewers -- the
  third was unavailable -- so that round is not a complete three-model review**, and nothing it raised
  was deferred.
- Left as they are, on purpose: no runtime self-test of the dnoise gate against third-party compiler
  flags, no ledger charge for the filter's scratch, the 2^24 intensity bound and the recovery's search
  bounds.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-09-08

*Never published: v2.0.0 was an internal development tag, so the public version line runs 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
-> 1.2.0 and the changes below first reach users in 1.2.0.*

**Why 2.0.** The interface breaks: the executable is `spextractor`, so every script that called
`spextract` has to change, and ini files written by 1.x carry the old tool-name section and must be
regenerated (`-write_ini`). Two more things make a migration deliberate: a third OpenMS patch
(`MassTrace` move operations) is mandatory and a tree without it does not build the tool, and the
output is not digest-comparable with 1.x -- the defaults changed (charge floor, mobility veto, MS1
bands, allocator trim) and three corrections change spectra (the MS1 arena-compaction fix, the `C4`
calibration term, the window key). The public
release v1.0.0 (2026-09-04) was cut from the v0.3.0 tree described below, and v1.1.0 (the same day)
added the two defaults recorded under its own heading; from this release the private and the public
repository share one
version line, and the tool reports its own version (`--help`, the ini `version` parameter and the
output's software entry used to carry the OpenMS version).

**Where it stands.** On a 2-hour public diaPASEF acquisition (PXD047793, run 009; same node, both tools
at 100 threads) this release runs in **0.61x the reference implementation's wall time at 0.55x its peak
memory** (12:42 / 187.9 GB against 20:57 / 340.6 GB) and, under per-charge FDR control at 1%, identifies
**1.28x the peptides with Sage and 1.00x (0.996) with MSFragger** (27,831 / 28,181 against 21,743 / 28,294);
on run 001 the ratios are 1.25 / 0.98. Whole-run entrapment FDR on the 2-hour files is at the nominal
1% (0.93-1.03% under the engines' pooled cut, 0.98-0.99% under the per-charge walk; dataset D reads
1.33%). The
30-minute dataset D runs in 3:13 at 57 GB. The record is docs/BASELINE.md (sections dated 2026-09-06 to
2026-09-08) and docs/REFERENCE-COMPARISON-2026-09-08.md.

### Changed
- **`charge:min_charge` default 2 -> 1, with a new ion-mobility charge veto (`charge:im_charge_veto`,
  on; `charge:im_veto_band`, 2.5 MAD-sigma).** The old default was confirmed on the three 30-60 minute
  in-house files; on a 2-hour tryptic acquisition emitting z=1 gains 14-20% Sage peptides (12-17% of
  the larger count) and most of the MSFragger deficit against the reference implementation. Those identifications are physically singly charged: short (7-9 aa),
  lysine-terminated, single-basic-site tryptic peptides whose 1/K0 sits **+0.29 Vs/cm2 above the 2+
  trend line** at the same m/z in 99.4-99.9% of cases -- identically in the reference implementation's
  own 1+ identifications -- and which co-elute with their own 2+ ion where both are seen. Charge
  halving is nevertheless real: the count walk calls a 2+ envelope z=1 whenever its M+1 is missing or
  already claimed and its M+2 is present -- 11-26% of z=1 calls depending on the file, 60% of them
  below m/z 750 where a 1+
  cannot be scored at all. TIMS resolves it: the 2+ and 3+ mobility lines are fitted per run from the
  run's own confident calls; a z=1 whose mobility lies on the 2+ line is re-called 2+, and one on the
  3+ line is dropped. The 3+ arm was measured before it was settled: re-calling those to 3+ identified
  essentially nothing (z=3 peptides +9 on run 009, +47 on dataset D) while adding 178k / 93k re-called
  precursors (117k / 73k spectra) -- only ~1.8% of z=1 calls are genuinely on the 3+ band, and the two
  lines are ~1 sigma apart at low m/z -- so dropping them takes 2.9% / 7.9% off the v37 spectrum list
  at a cost below 0.3% of peptides on either engine under either walk.
  Two things to know. Under the engines' pooled 1% cut the z=1 stratum carries more entrapment FDR than
  the rest -- 2.9% on the 2-hour files, ~9% on dataset D where the stratum is ~150 peptides -- and
  a whole-run figure hides it. The mechanism is a lower true-match prior in that stratum under one
  pooled threshold, not peptide length (at matched score *and* length z=1 is still 3-5x dirtier than
  z=2; decoys reproduce it). A per-charge FDR walk puts the stratum at 0.87-0.91% on the 2-hour files
  while keeping the gain (Sage per-charge +20.2% / +13.7% on runs 001 / 009 against the old default), so report FDR by
  charge downstream.
- **`perf:ms1_trace_bands` default 12 -> 48: MS1 tracing is 2x faster.** The earlier sweep concluded
  more bands were worse (12/24/48 -> 75.0/93.7/147.9 s) but it was measuring a *serial* band
  distribution that grew with the band count. With that step parallel the order inverts:
  **41.7/27.1/20.4 s at 9.8x/18.4x/32.4x**. Gated on both datasets -- Sage 0.9999 / 0.9994,
  MSFragger 1.0002 / 1.0203, entrapment FDR 1.26->1.24% and 1.12->1.07%.
- **Mass-trace detection distributes its bands in parallel, and the seed list is segmented per
  band.** Two serial stages were setting the floor. (1) The MS1 band distribution copied every
  peak into its band's sub-map on ONE thread -- measured at 51% of the MS1 phase (39.0 s of
  75.9 s on a 30-minute file), and it is why raising `perf:ms1_trace_bands` made that phase
  strictly *worse* (12/24/48 bands -> 75.0/93.7/147.9 s at 3.9x/3.5x/2.5x): more bands is more of
  exactly this copy. Chunking over spectra takes it to 0.55 s (the phase to ~37 s on the 30-minute
  file, 106.2 s at 11.2x on the 2-hour one).
  (2) `prepareTracing` sorted up to 239 million seed indices on one thread and each of the 12
  bands then walked that whole list to find its own; segmenting by band first and sorting the
  segments independently is exact (`filter_b(sort(all)) == sort(filter_b(all))` for a total
  order) and takes per-window prep from 60.1 s to 27.1 s at the worst window, 904 s to 393 s
  summed. Both are byte-identical on both benchmark files.
- **`findPartner`'s gate fields are laid out in m/z order.** Precursor inference was
  single-threaded and 22-25% of a 2-hour run; it chased RT and IM through 48-byte records one
  cache miss at a time. Same values, same order, same first match -- **438.8 s -> 177.2 s**. The
  phase logs its three stages; the residue was the greedy claim loop (156.3 s), not the sorts
  (8.5 s), which the next two entries take on.
- **Two hot loops compute their index instead of searching for it.** `best()`, the innermost step
  of integer tracing, ran a `lower_bound` over its frame's ~25,000 sorted flight-time bins on every
  frame step of every trace extension; the bin is an integer the instrument produced, so a
  per-frame direct-address row (~32 peaks per bucket) makes the search start a subtract and a
  shift -- **window loop -19% at -9% CPU**. `findPartner`, in the greedy claim loop, searched 22
  million doubles up to 50 times per seed; the key there is the top bits of the IEEE-754 pattern,
  monotone for positive doubles, so the bucket is one load and one shift and its width is
  *relative*, matching a ppm tolerance. Both exact -- the sub-range handed to the search provably
  contains the same position. (The natural key for the second is the flight-time bin too, but
  `Trace::tof` is 0 on the OpenMS MS1 path; that needs MS1 through the integer detector.)
- **Precursor inference is parallel and exact** (ordered speculation, batch `SPEXTRACTOR_SPEC_BATCH`,
  default 8192): precursor inference's thread occupancy went from 1.0x to **23.4x** on a 2-hour file
  (the greedy walk itself 129 s -> 7.8 s), with 0.7% of seeds re-evaluated and a byte-identical
  spectrum list on three files.
- **The trace record is 48 bytes, was 72.** It carried an 8-byte pointer to the store every trace of
  a vector already shares, an 8-byte copy of a calibration factor the store holds per frame, and an
  8-byte copy of the apex intensity the arena holds. The span accessors take the store explicitly,
  the factor is a 4-byte frame index, and the apex intensity is read through the arena (72 -> 56 -> 48).
  On a 2-hour acquisition this is the largest structure in the tool -- ~2.1 billion records, ~144 GiB
  at 72 bytes if simultaneous. The 72 -> 56 step measured -10.7 GB there and -2.7 GB on dataset D,
  less than the 16-24 GiB predicted from the record count because not every window's records are
  resident at once; the 56 -> 48 step, with the splitter's reserve, a further -5.5 GiB. A
  `static_assert` pins the size.
- **Renamed to SpeXtractor** (the previous name was taken): executable, class, namespace, macros and
  environment variables, source and test file names, CMake project and target, CI workflows, the
  OpenMS patches and every document. The GitHub repositories moved with it; the old URLs redirect.

### Added
- **`perf:malloc_trim`, on by default: 30% less peak memory for 8.5% more wall time.** The
  window loop's allocations stacked on top of everything the loading and MS1 phases had freed but the
  allocator kept -- measured, that floor is 138 GB at the loop start of a 2-hour acquisition.
  Returning it first (`malloc_trim(0)` at the two phase boundaries, glibc only) takes the peak from
  **265 GB to 186 GB** (measured interleaved across the memory pass, v13 -> v19, at the previous charge
  default; the trim step alone measured -28% peak for +6% wall, and with z=1 emitted the release
  peaks at 187.9 GB), with a byte-identical spectrum list. It is not free: the loop faults those
  pages back in cold (minor page faults +26%, window-loop CPU +15% at unchanged concurrency), which
  costs **+8.5% of wall time** measured interleaved on one node. On by default because memory is what
  bounds this tool -- it decides how many windows fit at once and whether a run fits the machine at
  all -- and off is one flag when time is the binding constraint.
- **Third OpenMS patch: move operations for `MassTrace`.** The class declares a defaulted destructor
  and copy operations, which suppresses the implicit moves, so every `std::move` of a mass trace --
  in OpenMS's own vector growth and in the band and split gathering here -- deep-copied its points.
  Two defaulted moves transfer instead; a `static_assert` on `is_nothrow_move_constructible` means a
  tree without the patch does not build the tool.
- **Memory and stage instrumentation**: allocator statistics (`mallinfo2`) at every milestone, so
  free-but-retained memory is measured rather than inferred; the picked-MS1 peak count; per-window
  seeds, parents to children, record and arena size and capacity; per-window stage seconds on every
  exit of the window body; an ordered slab digest under `SPEXTRACTOR_DET`; `[tstage]` MS1-tracing
  sub-stage seconds; `[tsub]` per-window trace sub-stages (slab / detect / merge / sort); the
  `[infer]` line now reports the speculation batch and its committed / re-evaluated / already-claimed
  counts; `[im-veto]` reports the fitted 2+ line, its sigma and the re-call / drop / keep counts.
- **Diagnostic knobs** (environment, off by default): `SPEXTRACTOR_Z1_DIAG[=path]` dumps the +ISO/2
  and +ISO/3 evidence for every z=1 call; `SPEXTRACTOR_Z1_CHARGE_UNSET` emits z=1 calls with no
  charge, so a search engine chooses; `SPEXTRACTOR_SPEC_BATCH=1` runs precursor inference
  sequentially.
- **End-to-end checks 9-13**: the shipped detector is the one that runs (9, 10), one isolation m/z in
  two ion-mobility slices is two windows (11), the MS1 arena compaction self-test (12), and the
  admission gate's logged high-water mark (13, on a one-window fixture). Thirteen checks; the suite ran every check on the
  `openms` fallback before 9 and 10 existed.
- **Build reproducibility.** The OpenMS patches were malformed (not orphaned) and are regenerated as
  unified diffs against the commit pinned in `patches/openms.lock`; the tool compiles against that
  upstream commit once the three patches are applied, without the separate mzPeak integration (every
  mzPeak reference is guarded; `-out_type mzpeak` refuses without a mzPeak build);
  the sqlite3 tdf reader is its own header (`src/TdfLoad.h`) with an include guard; the weekly CI job
  builds OpenMS from source at that pin, applies the patches and runs the end-to-end suite.
- **Cluster tooling** (development repository, not part of the public tree): the remote launcher starts
  a long job detached so the ssh channel is released,
  reserves its tag atomically, refuses a missing work directory and reports started / exited /
  failed distinctly; the benchmark drivers refuse to overwrite a measured arm and the publish step
  refuses to publish a binary that failed its own suite. The deploy script ships the
  launcher, the tool's headers, the end-to-end suite and its golden calibration file with every
  deploy and records the
  MassTrace-patch marker and the OpenMS library hash in the provenance.
- **Repository hygiene**: acquisition and specimen identifiers are scrubbed from the tracked tree
  (cohort samples are datasets A-F; the dataset-D baseline file is now `docs/BASELINE.md`; the drivers
  that need real paths are untracked, with tracked `.example` templates; run-directory names quoted in
  the record keep their historical labels); `evidence/` left the tree; CONTRIBUTING.md,
  SECURITY.md, issue and pull-request templates.

### Fixed
- **The scoring stage of a large isolation window was silently single-threaded.** libgomp's
  `GOMP_taskloop` runs the whole loop inline in the creating thread once
  `task_count + num_tasks > 64 * nthreads`; with the previous `grainsize(32)` that is 204,800
  precursors at 100 threads. Measured on the same libgomp at 100 threads and 20 us per iteration:
  200,000 iterations -> 82.7x, 300,000 iterations -> **1.0x**, and `num_tasks(400)` at 300,000 ->
  88.0x. On a 2-hour acquisition exactly two of 28 windows sit above that line, and they were the
  two that decided the run: they scored 417.6 s and 581.0 s where every neighbouring window --
  within 16% on fragment count -- scored 12-28 s, and the window loop's 748.5 s wall was one
  window's own 741.9 s chain. Scoring now uses a fixed pool of worker tasks (one per thread) that
  pull 32-precursor chunks from a shared cursor, so the task count no longer depends on the window
  size at any thread count. Spectrum output is unchanged (results were already written to pre-sized
  per-precursor slots).
- **MS1 arena compaction overwrote ~1% of precursor XICs.** The compaction that frees the profiles
  of unreferenced MS1 traces walked the trace vector in container order with a monotone write
  cursor, but the vector had been sorted by m/z after its spans were appended in detection order:
  kept spans visited after the cursor had passed their offset were overwritten before they were
  copied. Deterministic, so the thread-count digests never saw it. `compactUnreferenced()` walks
  the kept spans in offset order and validates bounds and disjointness before moving a byte;
  `-diag:selftest_arena` (e2e check 12) presents a fixture that defeats the old walk. Output changes
  (the corrected profiles feed fragment scoring); the digest baselines are re-taken.
- **`perf:max_concurrent_windows` was computed and logged but never checked**; the per-window byte
  projection booked 160 B/peak against 44 B measured, and the budget added the process's own RSS
  back into itself. Admission now happens on the master before a window task is spawned, so both
  bounds hold; the default (every window admitted) is unchanged, and e2e check 13 asserts the logged
  high-water mark.
- **Lifetimes.** The peak slab and the seed order are released before the band-arena merge, not
  after it; the MS1 traces, spans and precursors are released when the window loop joins, not at the
  end of the run; the retention-time axis is reserved for MS1 + MS2 frames; each `MassTrace` is
  released as it is converted; the valley splitter reserves its child count.
- **The determinism digest was blind to the fragment sort's primary key**: it now hashes `im` and
  `tof` as well. `bench/semantic_digest.py` missed a closing tag straddling a 4 MiB read boundary and
  accepted a truncated spectrum list; the e2e digest returned the empty hash for a missing list. New
  `bench/mzml_header_diff.py` compares everything outside the spectrum list (completion time masked).
- **One isolation m/z acquired in two ion-mobility slices is two windows.** The PXD017703 "py3"
  scheme (9 of 27 acquisitions) acquires each m/z window in two window groups with shifted,
  overlapping scan ranges ~1.7 s apart. Keyed by m/z alone they collapsed into one window whose
  frames were all of group A then all of group B, and the run stopped at the retention-time
  order guard. The window key now carries the `WindowGroup` from the vendor native ID; every other
  scheme has one slice per m/z, so their partition and order are unchanged. New e2e check.
- **The `C4` calibration term is modelled.** Bruker ModelType 1 files from a 2019 timsTOF Pro
  (firmware 6.0.110; 18 of the 27 public PXD017703 acquisitions) store `C4 = -0.0905`, which the
  model refused as an unmodelled higher-order term. Fitted against the vendor library, the residual
  of the shipped quadratic is closed by exactly one candidate correction -- an additive offset on
  the mass, `m = u^2 - C4` -- and with the temperature term the closed form reproduces the vendor
  library to 0.0000 ppm on the first and the last frame. Dropping it is -53..-938 ppm, worst at low
  mass. Bit-identical on every file with `C4 == 0`; `C3` stays refused (never observed non-zero).
  Both golden tests pin ten vendor probes on two frames and guard the ablation.
- **Runs on the public diaPASEF HeLa benchmark (PXD017703).** Three defects the in-house cohort never
  exposed: the calibration loader demanded exactly one `MzCalibration` row (these files have two;
  it now uses the row the frames reference, and falls back to the single-row rule when `Frames` has
  no such column), rejected a stored `C2 == 0` as missing (a real linear calibration on 2020 timsTOF
  Pro firmware; NULL is now told apart from zero), and -- on a stock OpenMS install -- silently fell
  back to the `openms` detector because `loadTofAxis` sat behind a `__has_include` for an in-tree
  OpenMS header. Both tdf readers now use the sqlite3 C API and a missing SQLite is a compile error.
  First public-data extraction: 136,818 spectra in 57 s.
- **Calibration fails closed on unmappable frames.** `loadTofAxis` no longer backfills index 0; the
  integer detector refuses input whose native IDs carry no parseable frame number and falls back to
  `openms` with a loud warning instead of a silent one.

### Measured
- **`perf:stream_load` is a sensitivity/resource trade, not a free default.** Both readers searched
  with both engines on two datasets plus entrapment: equivalent on the smaller file, but on the
  larger one the one-shot reader finds +223 Sage peptides (+2.0%) at unchanged entrapment FDR
  (1.13% vs 1.15%) -- real signal the streaming path loses, for 1.75x the memory and ~1.7x the wall.
  The default stays `true`; `false` is now documented as the more sensitive setting.
- **Entrapment FDR on all six datasets at the v0.3.0 defaults (2026-09-05): 1.13-1.31% at a nominal
  1%**, every interval overlapping. At this release's defaults the whole-run figure is 1.33% on
  dataset D and 0.93% / 1.03% on the 2-hour runs 001 / 009, with the z=1 stratum at 2.9% under the
  pooled cut and 0.87-0.91% under a per-charge walk. The point estimates sit within a third of a point
  of the nominal 1% (dataset D's is the high one, 1.33%); intervals were not re-computed for the v38
  arms.
- **`SPEXTRACTOR_PICK_BATCH` is fast and rejected.** 256 -> 4096 is -39% on the load phase, but the
  digest changes with the batch size and 4096 loses 7.2% of Sage and 6.1% of MSFragger peptides: the
  picker carries per-thread state across frames. The batch stays at 256, and the sensitivity is on the
  backlog as a correctness question.
- **Head to head with the reference implementation at this release's defaults** (PXD047793 run 009,
  the same node, both tools at 100 threads):

  | | reference implementation | DIAspeXtractor v2.0.0 | ratio |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | wall | 21:12.24 / 20:41.46 (mean 20:56.9) | **12:42.21** | **0.61x** |
  | peak RSS | 357.7 / 323.4 GB (mean 340.6) | **187.9 GB** | **0.55x** |
  | Sage peptides, per-charge 1% -- 009 | 21,743 | **27,831** | **1.28** |
  | MSFragger peptides, per-charge 1% -- 009 | 28,294 | **28,181** | **1.00** |
  | Sage, per-charge -- 001 | 15,418 | **19,262** | **1.25** |
  | MSFragger, per-charge -- 001 | 19,652 | **19,230** | **0.98** |
  | Sage peptides, engines' pooled cut -- 009 / 001 | 18,920 / 14,764 | 27,855 / 19,035 | 1.47 / 1.29 |
  | MSFragger, pooled -- 009 / 001 | 27,427 / 18,745 | 26,559 / 18,212 | 0.97 / 0.97 |

  The reference is a JVM run with `-Xmx400G`, so its peak partly reflects what it was allowed; the
  honest memory statement is "roughly half, and not sensitive to a heap flag". The DIAspeXtractor wall
  is one run against the reference's two-rep mean; the previous default's two reps spread 8%. Before this cycle the
  same file ran 1.46x *slower* than the reference (31:27 against 21:28).

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-04 (public release)

### Changed
- **`-threads` defaults to every core.** TOPPBase's default of 1 was the wrong one for a tool whose
  window loop is essentially the entire runtime. An explicit `-threads 1` is still honoured: the
  command line is inspected rather than the value compared. On 224 cores against the benchmark's
  `-threads 100`: 5:10 vs 5:22 for byte-identical output (a single pair).
- **The output format follows the `-out` extension, `.mzpeak` by default in a build with mzPeak; `-out_type` forces it.**
  mzPeak (Parquet inside a zip) is about a third the size of mzML (2.25 GB against 6.23 GB for the
  same 655,776 spectra). DDA search engines read mzML, not mzPeak, so write `.mzML` whenever a search
  comes next; the tool warns on every mzPeak write.
- CI runs on four platforms per push (Linux GCC 13 and 11, macOS arm64, Windows MSVC) and a weekly
  job builds the tool against an OpenMS source tree patched by `scripts/apply_openms_patches.sh`.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-09-04 (first public release)

The v0.3.0 tree below, with acquisition and specimen identifiers scrubbed, the six-dataset benchmark,
CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md and the issue templates.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-09-04

Published as v1.0.0 on 2026-09-04. The six-dataset table and the `perf:stream_load` note below were
added the same day, after the tag.

### Benchmark, all six datasets, shipped defaults only

`spextractor -in <file>.d -out pseudo.mzML -threads 100` and nothing else:

| file | spectra | wall | peak RSS | Sage @1% | MSFragger @1% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dataset A | 862,716 | 8:26 | 108.7 GB | 10,909 | 11,935 |
| dataset B | 585,503 | 5:37 | 84.6 GB | 10,272 | 9,691 |
| dataset C | 723,314 | 6:27 | 90.3 GB | 12,149 | 12,516 |
| dataset D | 655,776 | 5:21 | 79.0 GB | 12,482 | 12,337 |
| dataset E | 542,533 | 5:38 | 67.9 GB | 11,217 | 10,585 |
| dataset F | 597,267 | 5:59 | 73.8 GB | 11,362 | 11,049 |

dataset C and dataset F had never been benchmarked before. Peak RSS spans 67.9-108.7 GB across the cohort,
which is where the README of the time stated an 80-125 GB requirement.

### Changed
- **`assembly:require_isotope_support` and `perf:stream_load` now default to TRUE.** Both were
  `registerFlag_`, so they defaulted to OFF -- while every benchmark figure this project has ever
  published passed them explicitly. The shipped default configuration had therefore never been
  measured. It has now been, and it was **6.9x slower and worse on both engines**: with
  `require_isotope_support` off, dataset D emits 1,255,577 spectra in 36:25 at 6.0x window-loop occupancy
  for Sage 12,212 / MSFragger 12,148; on, it emits 655,776 in 5:15 at 65.7x for Sage 12,482 /
  MSFragger 12,337. (An earlier measurement in July had put the gate's cost at −0.78% peptides; the
  sign flipped somewhere behind the charge gate, the apex estimator and the integer detector.)
  Without `stream_load` the loader holds the entire run at a measured 90.3 GB floor, which by itself
  exceeds the tool's current total peak. Both are now `<true/false>` options, since a flag cannot
  default to true; pass `false` to restore the old behaviour. **`perf:stream_load` also CHANGES
  OUTPUT** -- checked rather than assumed, and the assumption was wrong: true gives 655,776 spectra
  in 5:11 at 78.4 GB, false gives 656,371 in 10:30 at 121.8 GB, and the spectrum lists are not
  identical. The two readers pick peaks on different frame groupings. (Which one is closer to the
  truth was settled on 2026-09-05 -- see "Measured" under v2.0.0: the one-shot reader is
  slightly better on a large file, at unchanged entrapment FDR, for 1.75x the memory.) Every figure
  this project has published used `true`. This is the same class of defect as
  the `ms2_noise_threshold_int` / `ms2_split_valleys` mismatch fixed on 2026-09-03 -- that sweep
  checked value-bearing options and missed the flags.

- **`charge:min_charge` now defaults to 2**, dropping singly-charged precursor hypotheses before
  extraction. They are ~30% of emission and ~1.7% of peptides, and removing them GAINS peptides on
  both search engines on all three benchmark files (Sage +0.8/+2.7/+1.4%, MSFragger +1.2/+5.4/+0.9%)
  while cutting emission ~30% and runtime 17%. Entrapment FDR stays inside the previous 95% interval
  on every file. Set `charge:min_charge=1` to restore the previous behaviour.

- **Shipped defaults now match the benchmarked configuration.** `trace:ms2_noise_threshold_int`
  100 -> 10 and `trace:ms2_split_valleys` 0 -> 7.0. Every published figure was produced with 10 and
  7.0 passed on the command line, so a default run could not reproduce any of them.
- **`trace:mz_estimator` is a real parameter** (default `apex`), replacing an undocumented
  environment variable that silently set every reported precursor and fragment m/z.

### Added
- Parameter bounds on the numeric options. A negative count used to wrap through `Size`
  (`min_fragments -1` became ~1.8e19 and nothing was emitted) and a negative tolerance gated
  everything out; both failed as an empty but valid-looking result.
- `bench/iso_dup.py`, `bench/iso_collapse.py`, `bench/iso_sim.py`, `bench/iso_loss.py`,
  `bench/iso_guard.py`: the isotope-duplication census, collapse-rule evaluation, content-similarity
  test and loss trace behind the emission findings.

### Changed
- **`trace:detector` now defaults to `integer`.** Mass-trace detection runs on the instrument's own
  integer axes -- flight-time bin for m/z, frame index for retention time -- following OpenMS
  MassTraceDetection step for step, and never materialises a PeakMap of doubles. On dataset D it is
  faster and uses ~40% less memory than the OpenMS path (dataset D 86 vs 150 GB, dataset A 126 vs 222 GB; wall
  6:21 vs 6:54 and 10:35 vs 11:14). The peptide effect is **mixed and not consistent in sign**: Sage
  -1.3% on dataset D but +0.2% on dataset A, MSFragger +2.1% on dataset D but -3.5% on dataset A, entrapment indistinguishable
  on both (dataset D 1.27% [1.03-1.52] vs 1.38% [1.14-1.63]). The detectors **agree on only ~85% of the
  union** of identified peptides -- 1,148 OpenMS-only and 981 integer-only on dataset D -- so the memory
  saving, not a peptide gain, is the case for the default. Without the vendor flight-time calibration
  the tool **falls back to `openms` and says so**; the emitted mzML records which detector ran as
  `spx:detector`.

### Performance (2026-09-04, round 2: three output-neutral changes)
Measured old-vs-new with both arms on the same host, three files concurrently on three machines,
one binary from a shared install. **Every arm is digest-identical to its base**, so peptides are
unchanged by construction and no search was run.

| | dataset D | dataset A | dataset B |
|---|---|---|---|
| RSS at end of the window loop | 65.0 -> **48.3 GB** | 85.6 -> **55.1 GB** | 70.0 -> **49.8 GB** |
| window-loop occupancy | 67.6 -> 69.9x | 56.2 -> 61.3x | 56.9 -> 63.3x |

**These are memory changes, not speed changes.** Replicated as interleaved base/clean pairs on
shared machines with the load recorded before each run -- three pairs on dataset D, two on dataset B, every
digest identical. dataset D: wall 321.3 -> 312.7 s (−2.7%), window-loop CPU 9,229 -> 9,690 (**+5.0%**),
RSS at end of the window loop 63,880 -> 46,922 MB (−26.5%), process peak 81.3 -> 77.9 GB (−4.1%),
all with non-overlapping ranges. dataset B: no wall-clock difference at all, same ~4% CPU cost, same
~30% memory drop. So the trade is **~27% of the window loop's memory for ~5% more CPU at roughly
unchanged wall time** -- worth taking because concurrency is bounded by the free-RAM admission
gate, but it is a memory change. A first pass of single pairs appeared to show 5-6% off wall on
three files; that was load drift on shared nodes and is withdrawn. Do not cite a speed-up.

- **Valley splitting is streamed.** It used to build every trace of a chunk as an OpenMS `MassTrace`
  and then split the whole chunk, so the input payload and the entire split output were alive at
  once -- the two largest structures after the peak slab, 7.5-10.6 GB. One trace is now in flight at
  a time and those lines fall to 0.08 MB. `ElutionPeakDetection` is constructed and parameterised
  once per chunk rather than once per trace.
- **The fragment RT gate rejects on 2 bytes instead of 8.** The gate discards 99.4% of what it
  visits -- 867 billion visits, 6.9 TB of traffic per dataset D run -- and was reading a `double` to do it.
  A parallel `uint16` bucket array does the reject; the exact test is unchanged and runs only on
  survivors, so the candidate set and its order are identical (the score-gate counters match to the
  digit between arms).
- **Trace arenas are reserved before merging.** `absorb()` appended without reserving into a
  just-emptied destination, so 12 band merges and 48 chunk merges regrew geometrically.
- Process peak RSS falls only 2-5 GB because the peak is set outside the window loop; the loop
  ENDING ~30% lighter is what governs how many windows fit in flight.
- Rejected on evidence: compacting the peak slab to above-noise peaks (the seeds line reads 100.0%
  -- there are no sub-noise peaks, so the slab is irreducible), and moving the seed sort into the
  band tasks (<1% of CPU, and it re-partitions seeds across bands, which cost 3.3% of peptides once).

### Performance (2026-09-04, trace representation)
- **A trace's profile is a span, not a point list.** A trace point has one degree of freedom -- its
  intensity -- so the three parallel 4-byte arrays (frame, intensity, flight-time bin) and their
  three allocations per trace are replaced by an entry frame and a range in a per-window arena, with
  zero meaning a missed frame. Verified **byte-identical on both detectors** on dataset D. The per-window
  correlation grid, which was a second copy of every profile, is gone. Window-loop memory falls from
  a 68.6 GB simultaneous peak to 27.9 GB (integer) / 32.4 GB (OpenMS); process peak RSS 105 -> 88 GB
  and 164 -> 147 GB.
- **The `SPEXTRACTOR_MEM_LEDGER` byte ledger has been REMOVED** (it was temporary scaffolding for the
  memory work above and is gone as of the round-2 changes; ~86 lines). While it existed it was
  corrected twice: the trace line had been cumulative rather than a peak, and a 6.0 GB
  `list<Peak2D>` line was a phantom (that list is per trace and dies each iteration). The structural
  wins it was built to find are permanent: the visited flags are a bitset (4.87 -> 0.61 GB), and the
  slab and per-window preparation arrays are released before valley splitting rather than held
  across it.

### Performance (2026-09-03, window loop)
- **The scoring gate reads its one field from a parallel array instead of striding the 96-byte
  trace record.** The gate rejects 99.4% of the fragments it visits; the scan was moving ~83 TB per
  dataset D run for 8 bytes of payload per visit. dataset D wall 12:53 -> **7:17**, scoring stage 47% -> 4.8% of
  window time, **peptide set identical** on Sage. Replicated three times.
- **The window loop is one OpenMP task pool over all threads** (master/worker) instead of a rigid
  threads/bands x bands grid; window-loop occupancy 65x -> 81x on 100 threads. The number of windows
  resident is bounded by the free-RAM admission gate, whose per-window estimate was re-calibrated
  (10x -> 16x compact bytes; it had been under-booking by 35-55%).
- **The retention-time axis is a global frame index.** A trace point is (frame index, intensity),
  8 B instead of 16, and aligning two profiles is integer equality instead of a binary search per
  point; the per-window correlation grid is built without collecting or sorting ~10^8 RT values.
- `trace:detector=integer`: mass-trace detection on integer arrays with the instrument's flight-time
  bin as the m/z axis, following OpenMS MassTraceDetection step for step, calibration re-applied only
  at export. Introduced here behind the flag at 6:53 wall / 105 GB against 7:17 / 164 GB for the
  OpenMS path; it became the default later the same day, on the numbers under "Changed" above.
  See docs/INTEGER-TRACING-DESIGN.md.
- Band-count sensitivity measured: 4/6/12/25 bands move the peptide set by −0.02% to +0.10% and
  differ in ~2% of spectra's content. Banding is an approximation, not exact as the help had
  claimed; the halo is now sized per edge.

### Fixed
- MS1 traces are filtered for non-finite coordinates before sorting. A NaN made the comparator
  non-transitive, which is undefined behaviour in `sort()` and silently corrupts every later binary
  search. The fragment path already did this; the MS1 path did not.
- `FragGrid` CSR offsets widened to 64-bit. At 8.5 M fragments and ~510 support points each, the
  32-bit offsets were within a factor of two of wrapping, and an overflow there silently corrupts
  every correlation rather than crashing.
- mzPeak input fails loudly instead of degrading: an unknown frame no longer falls back to the
  reference temperature while still being stamped as exactly calibrated; a short batch result from
  the reader no longer leaves empty tail frames; mismatched m/z, intensity and mobility array
  lengths are rejected instead of truncated to the shortest.

### Removed
- The raw apex-frame fragment backfill and the pre-extraction isotope collapse, with all their
  environment gates. Both were measured on all three files and falsified in every configuration;
  the results are in `docs/BASELINE.md` and `docs/ISOTOPE-DUPLICATION-2026-09-03.md`, and the
  implementations are in the git history. 160 lines.
- An unused per-window band-count heuristic that a comment described as kept for reference.

### Runtime
- **MS1 path parallelised** (loader `[SpeXtractor ms1-par]`: batched parallel MS1 decode with per-thread ZSTD contexts and
  `FrameCentroider`, ordered hand-off; consumer `flushMS1_`: parallel MS1 pick). dataset D/100 threads: LOAD 445 s -> 39 s,
  total 22:22 -> **15:21**; spectrum data byte-identical, Sage peptide set identical.
- Decode-once frame-major parallel MS2 loader (`[SpeXtractor par-load]`), batched parallel MS2 pick; per-phase `[perf]`
  table and `[perf-load]` decode/hand-off/pick timers; `SPEXTRACTOR_LOAD_ONLY=1` for load-only profiling.
- Falsified and recorded: `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4` (10x slower at 100 threads), loader batch depth (64/256/1024 flat).

### Input
- **Streaming `.mzpeak` input** (`src/MzPeakStreamLoad.h`, build-optional `-DMZPEAK_ROOT`) on the mzPeak C++ library
  (OpenMS/mzpeak fork trunk); reads ims-compact archives with per-window mobility bands (works around name-only band
  params and NULL `precursor_index`). Benchmarked: not faster (the floor was the MS1 pick), and -11.7% peptides from the
  archive's two-point TOF transform (fragment error +10 ppm) -- see the runtime plan and the converter
  handoff. Output stamps `spx:mz_calibration = mzpeak_two_point_transform ...` for this path.
- Library build recipe for GCC 13 / Arrow 23 (`scripts/build_mzpeak_lib.sh`, `patches/spx_ranges_to.h`,
  `patches/mzpeak-cpp-arrow23.py`).

### Determinism
- `bench/semantic_digest.py` now stops at `</spectrumList>`: the trailing `<indexList>` byte offsets shift with any header
  length change and had falsely flagged two spectrum-identical files. Loader batch size does NOT change content
  (922,902 spectra, 0 differ; Sage set identical), and **neither does the thread count**: threads 8 == threads 100 on two pairs with the fixed digest, retracting the 2026-09-01 "thread-count dependent" finding. Output is byte-identical spectrum data at any thread count and loader batch.

### Scoring / assembly
- **E5:** `apportion` and `rp_max` now go through the same emitted-intensity weights as the default path
  (`weighted_()`); they had silently bypassed `corr_power`/`im_weight`, so every earlier A/B of those flags was
  confounded. First clean apportion run: -3.9% peptides (falsified again; NNLS cut).
- **Reported m/z of every trace is now the APEX member's m/z** (`SPEXTRACTOR_MZ_ESTIMATOR=apex`, the new default;
  `mean` restores the OpenMS intensity-weighted centroid): dataset D +2.6% Sage (12,537 vs 12,217) and +4.1% MSFragger
  (11,927 vs 11,463) with the paired precursor mass error vs the reference implementation +1.12 -> +0.78 ppm. Both-engines gate passed;
  generalises: dataset A +4.4% (10,789), dataset B +2.7% (10,156); mean ratio vs the reference implementation on Sage 105.1% -> 109.2%;
  entrapment of the apex arm 1.28% [1.03-1.53] at nominal 1%.
- Under test (env switches, defaults unchanged): `SPEXTRACTOR_PICK_MZ_MODE=seed|top3` (pick-level m/z; the -2.4 ppm
  fragment offset vs the reference implementation is upstream of the trace estimator), `SPEXTRACTOR_DROP_PREC_ISO=1` (drop the precursor's
  M+1..M+3 from fragment lists; 28%/25% of spectra carried them -- FALSIFIED, -2.3%, keep off), `SPEXTRACTOR_MZPEAK_EXACT` (now the default; `=0` accepts the two-point m/z),
  `SPEXTRACTOR_MIN_ISOTOPES=k` (precursor gate by envelope depth; k=3 = -39% emission, -23% wall, MSFragger -0.9%, Sage -6.4%),
  `SPEXTRACTOR_PRECURSOR_LIST=<tsv>` (emit only precursors matching a reference list), `SPEXTRACTOR_BACKFILL_RAW=N` /
  `SPEXTRACTOR_BACKFILL_MAXFRAGS=K` (add the N most intense untraced raw peaks of the apex frame inside the IM band:
  N=50 lifts MSFragger to 90% of the reference implementation at -2.6% Sage; faint-tail-only variant under test).
- Output-identical: band partition by binary search (R3), early skip of fragments below `min_corr_pts` support.
- Help texts of falsified flags (`rp_max`, `consolidate`, `merge`) now say so; `charge:iso_im_tolerance` help
  no longer contradicts its default.

### Benchmark findings
- MSFragger gap is per-precursor CONTENT of the faint tail: same precursor population as the reference implementation -> 85.0%; emission -39% -> 84.8%;
  dt-only peptides are searched but short by ~2 of ~9 matched ions that never become a trace; raw apex-frame peak
  backfill recovers 1,151 of them (MSFragger 85.6% -> 90.0%). FragPipe rescoring (Percolator, MSBooster off for both) gives 13,211 vs the reference implementation
  15,947 peptides (82.8%; raw-hyperscore walk 85.6%) -- rescoring lifts both tools and leaves the ratio; ours has
  8.6 PSMs/peptide vs 2.0. Entrapment of the shipping arm: 1.28% / 0.95% / 1.32% at nominal 1% on dataset D/dataset A/dataset B.
- Falsified today (kept in docs so they are not re-proposed): apportion (clean, -3.9%), precursor-isotope stripping
  (-2.3%), median/seed/top3 m/z estimators, 48 MS1 trace bands (slower, not output-identical), MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4.

### Docs
- an internal backlog register: every open issue with status, root cause, fix and gate. Confirmed: apportion/rp_max bypass corr_power (E5); 28% of spectra carry the precursor M+1 as a
  fragment (C9); false mzPeak calibration provenance (fixed).

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-02

First release with a verified calibration, tests, and CI. Supersedes v0.1.0, which was tagged on the
day-one commit and never represented a working state.

### Headline: exact, license-free TOF -> m/z calibration
The Bruker `.d` reader converted TOF to m/z with a two-point linear-in-sqrt chord that is **-5 to -11
ppm biased** (m/z dependent). We derived the exact ModelType-1 model from the constants in each
file's own `MzCalibration` table and verified it to **2.5e-5 ppm** against Bruker's library:

    t_ns   = tof * DigitizerTimebase + DigitizerDelay
    C1_eff = C1 * (1 + dC1 * (T1_ref - T1_frame) / 1e6)
    t_ns   = C0 + (1e6 / sqrt(C1_eff)) * sqrt(m) + C2 * m

The widely-copied open implementation (timsrust-calibration, adapted then disabled by mzdata as "not
consistently better") **drops the `C2*m` term** -- worth -11..-40 ppm. That omission, not translation
subtlety, is why the port underperformed. Reported upstream.

Measured on three diaPASEF files, closed search: **+6-11% Sage peptide identifications**, no vendor
library. This is an identification-YIELD effect, not better spectra (emission moved -0.2%): mass
error is a feature of Sage's discriminant. Since the reference implementation always carried vendor-calibrated masses,
every earlier head-to-head was biased against the open path -- this removes a self-inflicted
handicap rather than establishing a lead.

### Benchmarks (3 files, both engines, identical settings; docs/BENCHMARK-MATRIX-2026-09-01.md)
| | dataset D | dataset A | dataset B | vs the reference implementation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sage peptides @1% FDR | 11,976 | 10,333 | 9,891 | mean 105.1%, 95% CI [93.0, 117.3] -- consistent with PARITY |
| MSFragger peptidoforms @1% | 11,463 | 11,465 | 9,404 | mean 85.0%, 95% CI [76.7, 93.2] -- a supported DEFICIT |
| median precursor mass error | +1.5 | +3.2 | +2.3 ppm | the reference implementation -1.4 / +0.3 / -0.6 |
DIAspeXtractor also emits ~1.32x more spectra, so per-spectrum efficiency favours the reference implementation. The MSFragger
gap survives perfect masses and is therefore search/detection-side.

### Safety
- **Fails closed.** ModelType != 1, `C2 <= 0` (a NULL/text C2 reads as 0.0 and selects the known-bad
  pure-sqrt law), `dC2`/`C3`/`C4` != 0, implausible `C1`, NaN, multi-row tables, or an unreadable
  `Frames.T1` are all errors, not silent approximations. `SPEXTRACTOR_ALLOW_CHORD_FALLBACK=1` (exactly
  "1") opts back into the biased chord.
- **Provenance.** Every emitted mzML records `spx:mz_calibration` =
  `tdf_table_modeltype1` | `bruker_sdk` | `legacy_chord_APPROXIMATE`, via an exported accessor that
  works across the shared-library boundary.
- Out-of-model inputs return NaN, never a plausible-looking 0.0.

### Tests and CI (first in this repo)
- `tests/test_calibration_cpp.cpp` -- 60 vendor-derived golden cases against the **shipped** header,
  round-trip inverse, and every rejection path. Ablation guards prove the suite can catch the
  known-bad implementation (39.4 ppm) and the temperature term (0.67 ppm).
- `tests/test_calibration.py` -- an independent re-implementation as a cross-check.
- `tests/test_entrapment.py` -- estimator CI, determinism, NaN-on-empty.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs all three. None needs a vendor library, cluster, or raw data.

### Determinism (scoped honestly)
Bit-reproducible **at a fixed thread count** -- verified by `bench/semantic_digest.py`, which compares
spectrum data and ignores the wall-clock stamp and the recorded parameters (two runs can never be
byte-identical otherwise; this also explains a July md5 mismatch left unexplained at the time).
Output DOES differ across thread counts, and last-ulp code changes cascade to ~2% in peptide counts.
The 0.06% noise floor in the decision rule is a SAME-BINARY figure.

### Also
- Entrapment estimator corrected (peptide-hypothesis ratio 0.6805, foreign-only counting, bootstrap
  CIs): actual FDR at nominal 1% is ~1.0-1.45%, not the ~2.3% previously reported.
- `assembly:corr_power=2` default (validated +8-10%, three files, both engines).
- Spectrum collapse falsified (-20..-60% peptides at every operating point, intrinsic to both tools).
- `scripts/apply_openms_patches.sh`; `the deploy script` refuses to deploy into an unpatched
  tree; evidence chain archived to durable storage.

### Known limitations
- Verified on ONE cohort/instrument; the three golden files share ONE MzCalibration vector.
- Public-data replication not yet done; every claim is single-cohort.
- A +1.5..+3.2 ppm residual remains, 2-4 ppm above the reference implementation on the same files. It survives every
  calibration path, so it is downstream of the m/z axis (centroiding / monoisotope reporting).
- Peptide counts are partly a mass-calibration measurement: compare only at similar residual ppm.
