# Apply DIAspeXtractor's OpenMS patches to an OpenMS source tree and install the shared calibration header.
#
# WITHOUT the calibration and MassTrace patches the tool does not build; without the EPD patch it builds and runs, but the Bruker .d reader falls back to a two-point
# linear-in-sqrt TOF->m/z chord that is -5..-11 ppm biased on the files we measured -- which costs
# ~6-11% of closed-search peptide identifications (docs/BENCHMARK-MATRIX-2026-09-01.md). The build is
# silent about it; only the run log says which calibration was used, and every emitted mzML carries
# the answer in the spx:mz_calibration userParam.
#
# Usage: scripts/apply_openms_patches.sh /path/to/OpenMS
#
# The patches are cut against the exact public OpenMS commit named in patches/openms.lock. Check
# that commit out first; against anything else they may fail, or worse, apply with fuzz.
